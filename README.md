# DataWarehouseFramework
This project is aimed at providing a Community SSIS ETL Framework which deals with the need to develop an ETL Framework from a different perspective to many other offerings. The theory is fairly generic and the source code is designed around a simplified system based on the need to understand the model as a generic approach and it is aimed at being easily consumable by the reader and simply extensible to more complex systems. However even the simplified model has some complexities designed to make the reader think about the complexities of building a DW.
